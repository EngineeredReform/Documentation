# Potential APIs

## The mission

To find APIs that will give us the data we need to figure out what the currently incarcerated population is, what the rate of recidivism is, and how we can track that year over year.

### Example table

This is something like what we're hoping to find. We want to know how many lives we need to touch to reduce recidivism by 1% and we would also like other data such as what percentage of prison population is made up of neurodiverse humans. We also want to know if what we're doing is working. We need to track these numbers year over year to see if we're even making a dent.

|Year     |Incarcerated |Recidivism |
|--------:|------------:|----------:|
|2019     |300          |80%        |
|2020     |250          |78%        |
|2021     |200          |76%        |

## What we've found (so far)

The first thing we want to document is the [search we used][1]. From that search we found 3 prospective candidates that have yet to be vetted.

- [Crime Data Explorer API][3]
