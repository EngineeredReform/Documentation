## What is an NPO?

If you're here, you likely already know what an NPO is. But just in case you don't, an NPO is a NonProfit Organization - which just means that it is a legal entity organized and operated for a collective, public, or social benefit. It is not meant to generate profit for the founders or owners. A deeper definition and further explanation can be found [here on Wikipedia][nonprofit_organization].

## How do I get started?

### Crafting your mission

First thing you need is a mission statement.

- What are you trying to accomplish?
- Sell me your dream!

Example:

> We are a 501(c)(3) organization aimed at helping both people with criminal backgrounds and those in recovery find transformation through employment and entrepreneurship specifically in the tech industry.
>
> We rely on our community of seasoned technology consultants and engineers to enable those who are getting out of prison to rebrand themselves as certified technologists in a variety of specialties: Cloud Engineering, Software Engineering, Engineer Management, and more.
>
> Even with all the schools and bootcamps out there, the tech community of today is having trouble meeting the industry's demand for skilled workers. Are you the next hire? The next tech entrepreneur? The next mentor? It's time to find out!

Three small paragraphs to tell who we're helping, who we are, and what impact we're aiming to have.

### Create your nonprofit

This is slightly expensive if you want to go the easy route, but it's worth the money, if you can afford it. I used [LegalZoom][legalzoom], which cost me around $350 in total for them to do most of the work for me. I filed in the state which I reside, which is Georgia. Costs may vary depending on the state.

### Create your branding

This step is difficult because you may not be artistically gifted (I know I am not). I'd suggest spending 15-30 minutes giving it a shot anyway, if only to feel the pain and have empathy for the designer you'll eventually hire to do some branding for you.

I started with [Canva][canva], made a free account, and tried out some of the logo templates they had there. I ended up just using a generic but classy-looking font ***Oswald*** and just the name of our NPO with a QR code to link to the website.

I even borrowed a ***Thank You!*** template from Canva and tossed an animation over it for good measure - now I can use this to personally thank our donors!

Another great free tool is [Pixlr][pixlr]. It's a little more on the Photoshop/Illustrator side of things, but it works well for a free product.

Eventually you may want to hire a human to do some more professional branding. If you do, I suggest checking out [Fiverr][fiverr] since you can search through past work and see what each person is capable of before you hire them. Prices can vary from $5 up to several hundred dollars depending on what you want. Free is the best place to start though.

### Create your domain

My wonderful friend and mentor [Carrisa Jones][carrisajones] told me about [Google for nonprofits][google_for_npos] which is a great service provided by Google, and feels very much like a one-stop-shop for NPOs. There's [a list of their product offerings, by country][google_product_offerings], to see what you may be eligible for. For other products and services outside of Google, [techsoup][techsoup] has been an incredible platform to work with.
