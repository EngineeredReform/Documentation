# Starting Up

## What is an NPO?

If you're here, you likely already know what an NPO is. But just in case you don't, an NPO is a NonProfit Organization - which just means that it is a legal entity organized and operated for a collective, public, or social benefit. It is not meant to generate profit for the founders or owners. A deeper definition and further explanation can be found [here on Wikipedia][nonprofit_organization].

## How do I get started?

### Crafting your mission

First thing you need is a mission statement.

- What are you trying to accomplish?
- Sell me your dream!

Example:
```text
We are a 501(c)(3) organization aimed at helping both people with criminal backgrounds and those in recovery find transformation through employment and entrepreneurship specifically in the tech industry.

We rely on our community of seasoned technology consultants and engineers to enable those who are getting out of prison to rebrand themselves as certified technologists in a variety of specialties: Cloud Engineering, Software Engineering, Engineer Management, and more.

Even with all the schools and bootcamps out there, the tech community of today is having trouble meeting the industry's demand for skilled workers. Are you the next hire? The next tech entrepreneur? The next mentor? It's time to find out!
```

Three small paragraphs to tell who we're helping, who we are, and what impact we're going to have.
